# Space-Wars-Ship-thing
This is the first game that I made using python, like 2 days after learning it in order to learn pygame in the free time. The tutorial followed is by Tech with Tim, and I have added a few changes by myself.
The thing with this file is that I made it using the virtual environment, so python was using the modules I installed using pycharm.
so you may have to reinstall these modules if you want to run the game.
